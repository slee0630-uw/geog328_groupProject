# Seattle EV Charging Stations
## Description
For our final project in GEOG 328, we decided to develop a web GIS application that highlights EV Charging Stations in Seattle, WA. The goal of our project is to visualize the spatial distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across Seattle and provide detailed information about each station to users (including the power level of each charger) to allow EV drivers to easily discover charging stations based on their specific needs.

## Goals
Our main goal was to make the process of finding EV chargers as quick, easy, and accessible as possible. To do this, we incorporated a filtering feature that allows users to enter their preferences for charging level (all levels, Standard plug, AC plug, or DC plug), availability, price (paid or free), and distance from their current location (within 1, 5, or 10 miles from them) to provide as seamless an experience as possible for their search. By analyzing the current distribution of EV charging stations throughout our project, urban planners and policy makers will be able to better understand the EV infrastructure network and make more efficient decisions for future expansion and sustainable city development.

## Main Functions
When users first open the web map they will see a map of Seattle with various color-coded icons scattered around the city, which is explained by the legend in the bottom right corner that allows users to identify the power level of the charger based on the color of the icon. On the left side of the screen, there is a list of all Seattle charging stations (with a button that allows users to input filters if desired).

If a user clicks on the "Filter" button, they will see a variety of filtering options to narrow down their search for an EV charger based on their needs.

Here's an example of what results would look like with the following filters applied: looking for a standard plug charger (level 1 charger) that is currently available at any price point with no limit of distance from their current location.

As you can see, there are two available options based on these particular filters, both located at or near Seatac airport as denoted by the icons. 

If a user finds a location on the map that they would like to navigate to, they can simply click the icon on the map to see the exact address of the charging station.

## Data Sources
Our web map uses location data published by Seattle City Light through its Public EV Charging Location ArcGIS map. The dataset consists of geospatial point features representing SCL-operated EV charging sites, along with associated attributes such as station details and charger types. The information is provided through a hosted ArcGIS feature layer and is meant for general reference as the City may update or modify the data at any time as needed.

## AI Disclosure
We used AI (primarily ChatGPT and Claude) to assist in generally understanding our data and to help style our maps. A large use of AI in our project was to help with debugging concerns and for clarifying questions about our development process when we found ourselves a little stuck or confused along the way. AI was used to create our favicon and color-coded icons on the map to help speed up the design process so we could focus on the features of the web map.
