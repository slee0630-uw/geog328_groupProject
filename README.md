# Seattle EV Charging Stations
## Description
For our final project in GEOG 328, we decided to develop a web GIS application titled “Seattle EV Charging Accessibility Map.” The goal of our project is to visualize the spatial distribution of electric vehicle (EV) charging stations across Seattle  and provide detailed information about each station to EV users (including the power level of each charger). In addition, by analyzing the current distribution of EV charging stations throughout our project, urban planners and policy makers will be able to better understand the EV infrastructure network and make more efficient decisions for future expansion and sustainable city development.
